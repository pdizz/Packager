Binary tree bin packing algorithm adapted from http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/7/bin_packing/

- Adapted growing bin algorithm to only grow up to preset size for packing to variable sized
  "bins" without empty space
- Added functionality to pack to multiple bins until all blocks possible are fitted
